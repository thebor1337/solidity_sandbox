# Solidity Sandbox

This repository contains examples of the implementation of various Solidity patterns and contracts with tests. Some of the examples may be similar to OpenZeppelin implementations. If you found this repository and want to use some contract, check if there's OpenZeppelin implementation first, I can't guarantee security and gas efficiency, I do it for learning purposes.

# Ready

Proxy contracts and patterns:

* [X] ERC1167 - proxy pattern to deploy identical contracts by cloning the master contract
* [X] Commit/Reveal pattern
* [X] TimeLock pattern
* [X] MultiSigWallet (added features to manage internal parameters)
* [X] Governance + DAO token

# TODO

* [ ] UUPS proxy pattern
* [ ] Transparent proxy pattern
* [ ] ...
